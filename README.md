Created pipeline using GitHub Actions Workflows to push changes made relating to AWS automatically without the need to manually type out code. For example, I created a new S3 bucket and only needed to push/commit my code - the pipeline I created with the help of Charlie is used to Deploy WordPress on Amazon EC2 and then perform an IaC Scan of the instance, however, this also deployed my new S3 bucket named "terraform-up-and-running-state4-brandon"
